# Cats-Dogs-Classifier-CNN
A simple CNN Classifier for Cats-Dogs dataset


Creating a simple DNN consisting of 2 convolutional and 2 dense layers.

The Model achieves accuracy of 78% during fitting

The dataset consists of 2 sets of images, cats and dogs, and our classifier identifies which animal of the two is present in a given image.
